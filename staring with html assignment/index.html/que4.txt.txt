tag

An HTML tag is a snippet of code enclosed within angle brackets ("<" and ">") that defines the purpose and
structure of a specific element on a webpage. Tags are used to instruct the web browser how to display the
content they enclose. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag, with the name of the
element enclosed within the tags.

<h1>html define structure of web browser</h1>

In this example,< h1> is the opening tag, and </h1> is the closing tag. The content "html define structure of web browser"is the
text within the h1 element.
